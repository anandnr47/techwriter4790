# Techniques Involved in Liquidity Management:

The two most common liquidity management techniques adopted by the bank are:  

- Target Balancing
- Notional Pooling

## Target Balancing or Account Sweeping
Target Balancing is transfer of funds from different accounts into central accounts to enhance the efficiency of cash management. Sweeping is done based on various attributes in sweep structure like sweep contracts, sweep features, sweep processes, sweep arrangement etc.

| <b>Fig.3 - Target Balancing</b>|

> As shown in the illustration:  
> 
> There are three levels of hierarchy.  
> 
> - In the case of zero target balance - as the net balances of the subsidiary accounts, 12 and 13 are in deficit, funds are transferred from the group account 1 to the subsidiary accounts to cover the individual deficits.  
> 
> - Conversely, the surplus funds in the sub account 11 are transferred to the group account 1. The net balance of group Account 1 post the sweeps is 6000.  
> 

## Notional pooling
Notional Pooling is offsetting of multiple balances at a single bank for the purpose of calculating interest on net balance. There is no tangible movement of funds. Interest is usually debited/credited to a designated master or header account.

>**Note:** Key difference between these techniques is that sweeping involves physical movement of money between two accounts whereas pooling is aggregating the balance notionally across multiple accounts without financial transaction
